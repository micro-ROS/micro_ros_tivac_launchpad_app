# micro-ROS app for TI Tiva™ C Series TM4C123G

<!-- [![CI](https://github.com/micro-ROS/micro_ros_azure_rtos_app/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/micro-ROS/micro_ros_azure_rtos_app/actions/workflows/ci.yml) -->

This example application has been tested in TI Tiva™ C Series TM4C123GXL LaunchPad using TivaWare SDK  2.2.0.295

## Dependencies

This component needs `colcon` and other Python 3 packages in order to build micro-ROS packages:

```bash
pip3 install catkin_pkg lark-parser empy colcon-common-extensions
```

## Usage

1. Clone recursively this repo:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/micro-ROS/micro_ros_tivac_launchpad_app.git
cd micro_ros_tivac_launchpad_app
```

2. Download TivaWare™ for C Series software development kit (SDK) [here](https://www.ti.com/tool/SW-TM4C)
3. Unzip the SDK to the root of this micro-ROS project. *Linux users: just open and unzip the .exe file*
4. Make sure that the SDK is in folder named `tivaware_c_series` or change its location in the `Makefile`

5. Build the project

```bash
make -j$(nproc)
```

4. Flash the board using [lm4tools](https://github.com/utzig/lm4tools)

```bash
lm4flash gcc/microros_tivac.bin
```
